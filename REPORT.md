# Mission 1

This mission was easy for me because the user interface was based on a previously created design. I have a hard time creating the user interface by myself.

I had mistakenly used awesome font icons instead of the ones included in the resources.

Also, I learned [how to prevent line breaks on my divs](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/css-prevent-line-break), which will come in handy for future projects. This fix was necessary so that the email elements didn't break the layout. 

# Mission 2

I had a hard time thinking of a UI that could fulfill the request. 

My solution was to create two columns when an email in the inbox email gets clicked. This action will create two columns: one column will be for the inbox email (this one will shrink) and the other one will be for the email body viewer.

It didn't take me long to code my solution, but it took me a lot of time to make it look good on Mobile. For the Mobile version, I ended up creating a container with a single column and three rows. The rows will be stacked in this order:
Inbox results
Inbox email viewer
Inbox email container

Also, I limited the maximum amount of expanded emails for a better user experience.

After that, I created a feature to delete expanded emails. This feature would help the user to discard emails that they are not looking for.

Then after cleaning up the code a little bit I was able to finish this mission.

# Mission 3

Writing the reports and improvement suggestions took me a while. I should write in English more often.

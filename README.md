# Description
Suppose we have a system which archives emails of an organization. In the event of security incidents (such as leakage of sensitive information via emails), this system will be used by the organization's auditing department to retrieve and verify the emails of the concerning parties through its admin console. We would like you to design the user interface (UI) mockup for this system.

# Mission 1: Design the UI using the given images

**Assignment:** Inside frontend_resources.zip (Please refer to resources section below), you will find a UI design file created by our designer (result.pdf) and accompanying images. Create the UI mockup using HTML, CSS, Javascript, etc. based on the design. You can use any framework or just vanilla JS to build this mockup.

# Mission 2: Extend the UI in order to implement a new feature

**Assignment:** In the search result section, extend the UI mockup so that user can inspect the body of each emails from the search result.

# Mission 3: Indicate UI parts that can be improved

**Assignment:** From the provided design, state your opinion on UI parts that can be improved, including the reason why and how you would improve them.

## **Rules:**

* Please use the images that we provide for the assignments.
* Please produce high-fidelity UI mockup for the assignments.
* Any fixed sample texts can be used as the data within the UI.
* For Mission 2: The extended design should allow user to inspect multiple email bodies at once.

## **What to include in the solution**

* The final UI mockup.
* An IMPROVEMENTS.md text file with the list of your suggested improvements, using Markdown format.
* A REPORT.md text file with a report describing your efforts in the process of completing the missions above.
* Push all your solution files to a Github **private** repository, and then install our Github App (PENDING) permissions to read it.

# Mission 4: Submit your solution

## Upload your solution to Github

For the solution submission, please create a private Github repository and commit your solution to it. We ask you to include only the required files in it.

## Give us permissions on your solution

For us to be able to get your solution, we need you to give us reading permission on your private repository. To do so, we need you to install our HENNGE Admission Challenge Github App in your private solution repository.

1. Enter to our Github App page: Click here.
2. Click "Install".
3. Go to your user, and look for your repository.
4. Accept and install.

# Build your solution request

First, construct a JSON string like below:

```
{
  "github_url": "https://github.com/YOUR_ACCOUNT/GITHUB_REPOSITORY",
  "contact_email": "YOUR_EMAIL"
}
```

Fill in your email address for `YOUR_EMAIL`, and the private Github repository with your solution in `YOUR_ACCOUNT/GITHUB_REPOSITORY`. Be sure you have double-checked your email address; we will contact you by email.

Then, make an HTTP POST request to the following URL with the JSON string as the body part.

`https://api.challenge.hennge.com/challenges/003`

## **Content type**

The `Content-Type:` of the request must be `application/json`.

## **Authorization**

The URL is protected by HTTP Basic Authentication, which is explained on Chapter 2 of RFC2617, so you have to provide an `Authorization:` header field in your POST request

* For the `userid` of HTTP Basic Authentication, use the same email address you put in the JSON string.
* For the  `password `, provide a 10-digit time-based one time password conforming to RFC6238 TOTP.

### Authorization password

For generating the TOTP password, you will need to use the following setup:

* You have to read RFC6238 (and the errata too!) and get a correct one time password by yourself.
* TOTP's Time Step X is 30 seconds. T0 is 0.
* Use HMAC-SHA-512 for the hash function, instead of the default HMAC-SHA-1.
* Token shared secret is the userid followed by ASCII string value "HENNGECHALLENGE003" (not including double quotations).

### Shared secret examples

* For example, if the userid is "ninja@example.com", the token shared secret is "ninja@example.comHENNGECHALLENGE003".
* For example, if the userid is "ninjasamuraisumotorishogun@example.com", the token shared secret is "ninjasamuraisumotorishogun@example.comHENNGECHALLENGE003"

If your POST request succeeds, the server returns HTTP status code `200`.

# Rules

* You do not have to disclose how you achieved this mission at this time. Do not hesitate to use source codes or tools on the net, but do the exploring process by yourself of course, do not ask your friend to help you. The only thing that matters is that it works!
* No bruteforce attacks, please!

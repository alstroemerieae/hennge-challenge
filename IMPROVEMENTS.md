# Suggested improvements


## Add dark mode
This is an essential feature nowadays.

**I would add a button to toggle between dark and white modes.**

***

## Add theme colors
It would be nice to have some colors on the UI.

**I would add a config button to would let the user choose over a predefined set of theme colors.**

***

## Add bookmark for emails
Being able to bookmark certain items would be a nice addition to the app. This would help the user's to search/filter certain items faster. 

**I would add an icon next to the email. If the icon is clicked, then bookmark the email.**


***

## Add a filter
Being able to filter items would be a nice idea. In addition to the last suggestion, this will also speed up the user's search.

**I would add a config button that lets the user filter things  as:**
  - **If it has a file**
  - **If it has multiple receivers**
  - **If it has a bookmark/flag**
  - **Certain date range (Apart from the search bar)**
***

## Customize the results header
Being able to customize the header column items would be helpful for the user's search. For example, if the user doesn't care about the date, he should be able to delete that column.

**I would add a config button that lets the user choose whatever they want to get displayed on their results header.**
